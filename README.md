# Teach Yourself Exercise

## Details
I chose to dive into Java, learn the fundamentals, and then become acquainted with Spring - a Back-end Java Framework

I chose to learn about Java, as most of the jobs I have come across would like Java knowledge and experience. Before today, I had only heard of it and knew nothing else about it.

It is an Object-Oriented Programming Language and cross-platform. It was released in 1995 by Sun Microsystems. They developed Java to be able to run programs and applications on various devices with the mentality of "write once, run anywhere."

After only having a day to dive into the complex language of Java, I'm still not confident or comfortable with it yet. I definitely will be continuing to learn and practice with it, as it is a huge language that can be found everywhere.
